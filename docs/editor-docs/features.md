## Auto-Completions

-   Rich auto-completions for entities, loot tables, trades, spawn rules, biomes, items, blocks, recipes, features, feature rules, animations and animation controllers
-   Handcrafted: We don't trust the Minecraft documentation and you shouldn't either. That's why we wrote all suggestions by hand
