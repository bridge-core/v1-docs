# Editor

## About

bridge. is a powerful **add-on editor** designed to speed up your development process. It provides a rich editing experience for all files inside behavior and resource packs (JavaScript, JSON and functions) and provides a powerful work environment. Unleash the full power of add-ons with bridge. plugins and make use of rich auto-completions provided as you navigate through a file. **Creating Minecraft add-ons was never more convenient!**

## Latest Release

You can download the latest bridge. release [here](https://github.com/bridge-core/bridge./releases/latest)!
You can try out the latest version of bridge. v2 [here](https://bridge-core.github.io/editor/)!

## Why _you_ should use bridge.

Most importantly, JSON editors like bridge. guarantee that you cannot write invalid JSON.
Additionally, "bridge." has a few more specific features which other editors do not offer:

-   bridge. interacts seamlessly with Minecraft and loads behavior packs and the corresponding resource pack from the com.mojang folder automatically
-   You cannot make general file structure mistakes because rich auto-completions guide you through the file
-   You do not need to study vanilla files and/or the incorrect documentation to find out which arguments a component has
-   Support for plugins: From custom components to searching files - bridge. plugins can do almost anything
-   Developing is generally significantly faster
